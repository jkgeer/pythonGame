Contributing to the Karflooglesville Quest for Adventure {#welcome}
=====================

How to contribute?
---------

A basic and easy way for you to keep uniformity with the standard our code has set would just be to look at the raw code itself.
Assuming you don't have access to do that, just know that our levels are each individual files that will pull upon each other to advance or
sometimes regress a user's adventure. To that end, just make sure if you're advancing or progressing levels, you try to 
keep a similar level name ot ours.

In addition, this program makes use of 'for/while' loops to cut down on repetitive code and account for users input a wrong choice. An example of this is can be [seen here](http://i.imgur.com/PLFhe9r.png)
      
Finally, we use data dictionaries to account for our possible choices, so please start each level with the following:

Other than that, just be creative and have fun! Be sure to send a pull request to odorsey's repo of the game when you're done, and thanks for contributing!
